unit Variants;
{* Fake variants.pas unit for Delphi6 / Delphi7. Place it in a
   directory with your KOL/MCK (or other non-VCL) project, and
   this will save about 70K of code in the executable.
   Certainly, do it so, if you actually do not use Delphi Variant
   type in the application.
   NEVER REPLACE Variants.pas provided by Borland!
