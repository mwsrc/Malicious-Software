Messiah.
~~~~~~~~
	Messiah was created on 27.07.04 and is a Remote Administration 
Tool (R.A.T.)
Messiah was created for system administrators who may need to control
other computers they own. Messiah was not created to be used for
illegal purposes.

To list everything Messiah can do will take to long, but it is worth 
checking the rare and unique functions Messiah allow, suchas changing 
the remote computer's cursor or displaying an FBI screen and Dos
re-direction and batch file creation.
Also unlike most other R.A.T's I have created, Messiah comes with a 
fully stable File manager allowing the downloading of remote files as
well as many other functions.

All in all, Messiah is a fully equiped R.A.T.
